About Me

A few words about myself

#intro
Frontend developer focused on high-performance and visually expressive web interfaces. I actively participate in hackathons (finalist at PROCIFRA, Gazprom Hackathon), enjoy solving complex challenges, and building products where engineering meets aesthetics.

My stack includes Vue 3, Nuxt, TypeScript, Pinia, TanStack Query, Three.js, and WebGL. I place strong emphasis on user experience, responsiveness, and performance, and I frequently experiment with custom visual effects using SVG and shaders.

Even outside client work, I’m constantly learning—building personal experiments, exploring new APIs, competing in programming contests, and sharing knowledge.
